## 🔍 LOAD SOURCE ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

### Universal Load Analysis (Required for ALL load-related incidents)

> **Use these procedures for High Request Rate, CPU, Memory, or File Descriptor alerts**
>
> **Note**: Commands below use Docker logs, but you can perform equivalent queries using:
>
> - **Grafana/Loki**: Log queries and dashboards
> - **API calls**: Direct service endpoints for metrics
> - **MCP tools**: Grafana MCP server for automated queries
> - **Other monitoring tools**: Prometheus queries, Jaeger traces, etc.

#### Step 1: Multi-Dimensional Traffic Analysis

**Identify traffic patterns across IP, Account, and User dimensions:**

```bash
# Analyze request sources by IP address
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -oE "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

# Get top IP for detailed analysis
TOP_IP=$(docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -oE "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
echo "Top IP: $TOP_IP - Request count:"
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep "$TOP_IP" | wc -l

# Analyze by account ID patterns
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -oE '"account_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

# Analyze by user ID patterns
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -oE '"user_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

# Get top account for detailed analysis
TOP_ACCOUNT=$(docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -oE '"account_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
echo "Top account: $TOP_ACCOUNT - Request count:"
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep "$TOP_ACCOUNT" | wc -l

# Check users within top account
echo "Users in top account:"
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep "$TOP_ACCOUNT" | grep -oE '"user_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

#### Step 2: Behavioral Pattern Analysis

**Analyze authentication and request patterns:**

```bash
# Check authentication failures by account/user
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -E "(401|403)" | grep -oE '"account_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5

# Look for rapid-fire requests from same account/user combinations
docker logs currency-api --since=5m | grep -E '"account_id":"[^"]*".*"user_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5

# Check for rate limit violations
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -E "(rate.*limit|too.*many.*requests)" | grep -oE '"account_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c

# Analyze endpoint usage patterns
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -oE "(GET|POST) [^ ]+" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Check for unusual user agent patterns
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -oE 'User-Agent: [^"]*' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5
```

#### Step 3: Resource Correlation Analysis

**Correlate load patterns with system resources:**

```bash
# Check current system resources
docker stats currency-api --no-stream

# Correlate request volume with resource usage
echo "Request count in last 5 minutes:"
docker logs currency-api --since=5m | wc -l

# Check for large responses that might impact memory
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -E "200.*[0-9]{4,}" | grep -oE '"account_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5

# Check for data-heavy endpoint usage by account
docker logs currency-api --since=10m | grep -E "(history|rates|convert)" | grep -oE '"account_id":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head-5
```

#### Step 4: Load Classification Decision Tree

**Based on analysis results, classify the load source:**

1. **Legitimate Traffic Spike** (Distributed IPs/accounts/users, normal patterns)
   - Multiple IPs, accounts, users contributing
   - Authentication success rates normal
   - Request patterns match business usage
   - **Action:** Monitor closely, consider scaling with business context

2. **IP-Based Abuse** (Concentrated traffic from few IPs)
   - Few IPs generating majority of traffic
   - May include failed authentication attempts
   - **Action:** Consider IP-based rate limiting, document for blocking

3. **Account-Based Abuse** (Single account excessive load)
   - One or few accounts generating disproportionate load
   - May involve multiple users within account
   - **Action:** Account management escalation, account-level throttling

4. **User-Based Abuse** (Single user excessive load)
   - Specific user generating excessive requests
   - Check if associated with suspicious account patterns
   - **Action:** User-level throttling, account management review

5. **Endpoint Abuse** (Specific endpoint being hammered)
   - Unusual concentration on specific API endpoints
   - Check if endpoint has performance issues
   - **Action:** Endpoint-specific rate limiting, performance review

6. **System Issue** (Load without clear external cause)
   - No obvious traffic source correlation
   - May indicate internal loops, memory leaks, or bugs
   - **Action:** System restart, code investigation

### Load Analysis Documentation Template

**Always document findings in incident notes using this format:**

```text
Load Source Analysis Results:
- Analysis Time: [timestamp]
- Top 3 IPs: [IPs and request counts]
- Top 3 Accounts: [Account IDs and request counts]
- Top 3 Users: [User IDs and request counts]
- Classification: [Legitimate/IP Abuse/Account Abuse/User Abuse/Endpoint Abuse/System Issue]
- Correlation with Resources: [CPU/Memory/Response time correlation]
- Recommended Action: [Based on classification above]
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "Service Unavailable" Errors

1. **Check container status:**

   ```bash
   docker ps | grep currency-api
   docker logs currency-api --tail=20
   ```

2. **Verify port binding:**

   ```bash
   netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
   docker port currency-api
   ```

3. **Test direct container access:**

   ```bash
   docker exec currency-api curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

#### Database Connection Issues

1. **Verify PostgreSQL is running:**

   ```bash
   docker logs postgres --tail=10
   docker exec postgres pg_isready -U currency_user -d currency_db
   ```

2. **Check connection limits:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it postgres psql -U currency_user -d currency_db -c "SHOW max_connections;"
   docker exec -it postgres psql -U currency_user -d currency_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"
   ```

3. **Test connection from API container:**

   ```bash
   docker exec currency-api nc -zv postgres 5432
   ```

#### Authentication Problems

1. **Verify JWT configuration:**

   ```bash
   docker exec currency-api env | grep JWT
   ```

2. **Test token generation:**

   ```bash
   poetry run python -c "
   from currency_app.auth.jwt_auth import generate_jwt_token
   print('Token generated successfully:', generate_jwt_token('test', 'test')[:50] + '...')
   "
   ```

3. **Check token validation:**

   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(poetry run python -c "from currency_app.auth.jwt_auth import generate_jwt_token; print(generate_jwt_token('test', 'test'))")
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rates -v
   ```
